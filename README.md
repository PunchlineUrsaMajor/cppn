# cppn
CPPN for image generation and evolution.

CPPN designed to be evolved with an implemented NEAT algorithm. End purpose is to be able to generate images based on fitness compared to an image classifier. Essentially, I should be able to say "generate a goose" and it will evolve a pattern that the classifier believes is a goose.
